**Project Name:** Comparison of Algorithms for Parkinson's Disease Detection

**Abstract:**

This research project presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of six machine learning algorithms for predicting Parkinson's disease (PD). The study aims to identify the most effective algorithm in predicting PD at an early stage, allowing for timely intervention and improved patient outcomes.

**Dataset:**

The dataset utilized in this study is obtained from the UCI Machine Learning Repository. It comprises 195 instances from 31 individuals, providing a robust foundation for training and testing the machine learning algorithms. The dataset consists of various features, including demographic information, clinical data, and motor symptoms, which are crucial for PD diagnosis.

**Machine Learning Algorithms:**

The six machine learning algorithms evaluated in this study are:

1. **Random Forest:** A widely used ensemble learning method that combines multiple decision trees to make predictions.

2. **K-Nearest Neighbor (KNN):** A simple and effective algorithm that classifies instances based on similarity to a set of nearest neighbors.

3. **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** A powerful algorithm that creates a hyperplane to separate different classes of data points.

4. **XG Boost:** A scalable and efficient gradient boosting algorithm that combines multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.

5. **Multiple Layer Perceptron (MLP):** A type of artificial neural network with multiple layers of interconnected nodes.

6. **Deep Neural Network (DNN):** A complex neural network architecture with multiple hidden layers, capable of learning intricate patterns in data.

**Methodology:**

1. **Data Preprocessing:** The dataset is preprocessed to handle missing values, outliers, and irrelevant features.

2. **Dimensionality Reduction:** Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset while preserving critical information.

3. **Feature Ranking:** The Recursive Feature Elimination (RFE) algorithm is utilized to rank features based on their importance, helping to identify the most relevant features for PD prediction.

4. **Machine Learning Model Training and Evaluation:** Each machine learning algorithm is trained and evaluated using a 10-fold cross-validation approach. Various metrics, including accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, ROC AUC score, and confusion matrix, are used to assess the performance of the algorithms.

**Results and Findings:**

1. **K-NN Classifier Performance:** When applied to the original dataset, the K-NN classifier emerges as the most effective model with an impressive accuracy and recall score of 97%. This indicates that the K-NN classifier correctly identifies 97% of the cases, demonstrating its potential as a reliable tool can aid in the early diagnosis of Parkinson's illness.

2. **XG Boost Algorithm Performance:** The XG Boost algorithm also shows promising results with an accuracy rate of 95% when used with the original dataset. This high level of accuracy highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms for illness prediction and diagnosis.

3. **Comparison of Algorithms:** The performance of all six algorithms is compared across various metrics to identify their strengths and weaknesses. The results indicate that the K-NN and XG Boost algorithms consistently perform well, demonstrating their suitability for PD prediction.

**Conclusion:**

This study highlights the potential of machine learning algorithms for Parkinson's disease prediction. While challenges remain, our findings provide a strong foundation for future research in this critical area of healthcare. Further exploration of larger datasets, advanced feature selection techniques, and deep learning architectures can lead to even more accurate and reliable prediction models.
